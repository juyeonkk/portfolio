    <div class="description"><b1> Final project of the semester was to build a model and create a set of drawings for the Wedding Pavilion located on the coast of Lake Erie. Given a variety of architectural elements such as hedges, planes and cubes, we were required to created a 80’x80’ garden as well as a 20’ x 20’ cubical pavillion that meet the given programs and objectives. The main goal of this project was to create a substantial relationship between the exterior space and the interior space while creating the space for the parking, processing, viewing garden, reception area, meal serving area, and the bride power room. Final products of the project include: wooden model, site plan, section, elevation, paraline drawing, rendered imges and a process board.
